fmt prefers breaking lines at the end of a sentence, and tries to avoid line breaks after the first word of a sentence or before the last word of a sentence. A sentence break is defined as either the end of a paragraph or a word ending in any of '.?!', followed by two spaces or end of line, ignoring any intervening parentheses or quotes. Like TeX, fmt reads entire "paragraphs" before choosing line breaks; the algorithm is a variant of that given by Donald E. Knuth and Michael F. Plass in "Breaking Paragraphs Into Lines", Software—Practice & Experience 11, 11 (November 1981), 1119–1184.
